// Sure! Hereâ€™s a similar exercise for practice:

// Imagine you have a list of JSON strings that represent information about books. Each JSON string contains the book's title, author, and year of publication. Your task is to convert these JSON strings into a list of Book objects.

// Each Book class will have the following properties:

// title: The title of the book (String)
// author: The author of the book (String)
// year: The year the book was published (int)
// After converting the JSON strings to Book objects, print out the title and author of each book.

// What you need to do:

// Create a list of JSON strings, where each string represents a book with the title, author, and year information.
// Use the .map() method to convert each JSON string into a Book object.
// Print the title and author of each book in the list.
// Try implementing this and let me know if you need any help!
